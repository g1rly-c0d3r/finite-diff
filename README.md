# Finite Difference Heat Solver for a (future) 3D object.

This project closely follows Banks, B.W. Differential Equations With Graphical & Numerical Methods chapter 10. I plan to add new files every time I finish an example. My documentation may be sparse, but I will try to comment when needed. Again, this is a toy project for me to get back into C++, and learn numerical PDE solving.

You should be able to build this just like any other cmake project, either with CMake or your favorite wrapper. This project is also so I can learn how to use CMake.
